# ðŸ§© Test-CustomFieldIsSet.ps1

---

### Overview
This script checks whether a specified **NinjaOne custom field** is set or empty.  
It is useful for validating setup, ensuring required fields are populated, or confirming that a field has been intentionally left blank.

By default, the script **passes when the field has a value**.  
You can optionally reverse this behavior so it **passes when the field is empty** by using the **Field Must Be Empty To Pass** checkbox variable.

---

### How It Works
1. Retrieves the value of a specified **Custom Field** from NinjaOne.  
2. Checks if the field contains a meaningful value (not null, empty, or whitespace).  
3. Determines pass or fail based on the **Field Must Be Empty To Pass** variable.  
4. Exits with:
   - `exit 0` - Pass  
   - `exit 1` - Fail

### ðŸ§° Script Variables

Add the following Script Variables to this script

| Display Name | Variable Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| **Custom Field Name** | `customFieldName` | Text | The name of the custom field to check. |

### Using in a Condition or Compound Condition

This script can be used in **Conditions** or **Compound Conditions** in NinjaOne as a **Script Result**.  

When setting up your condition:
- Set the **Result code** to **not equal to 0**  
- Set the **Output** to **does not contain**  

This allows the condition to trigger properly when the script fails, based on your chosen logic.
